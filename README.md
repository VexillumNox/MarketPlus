## Troubleshooting

### 429 Too Many Requests

If you receive the error `429 Too Many Requests`, it means you're hitting the rate limit of the free-tier Alpha Vantage API. You can either:

- Wait for the rate limit to reset (usually after 1 minute)
- Consider upgrading your Alpha Vantage plan for higher request limits

> For further details, check the [Alpha Vantage API rate limits](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key)
